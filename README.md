# C-Project
I developed a program that will perform security authorisation based
on numeric codes.

The codes are four (4) single-digit integer numbers between 0-9.
The program should allow a user to enter any four-digit code or generate a random
code, encrypt the code and compare it to a fixed, authorised access code.

The program should also allow the user to decrypt an already encrypted code.
When your program begins executing, the default authorised access code is 4523
(encrypted format of the number 1234 â€“ see encryption algorithm below). This code
must be stored in a 1-Dimensional array called access_code and should not be
allowed to be changed.
